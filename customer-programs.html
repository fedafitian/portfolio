                </p>
                <p><strong>Duration:</strong> October 2021 - April 2022</p>
                <p><strong>Role:</strong> Product Management Engineer & Program Lead</p>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    As a <strong>Product Management Engineer</strong>, I led the Early Access (EA) and Limited Availability (LA) programs for BIG-IP Next, a next-generation solution redefining application delivery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My focus was on turning technical insights into customer-driven solutions by collaborating with many teams and engaging with customers to refine BIG-IP Next before its full launch. These programs helped gather valuable feedback, align stakeholders, and drive adoption through hands-on demonstrations and real-world use cases.
                </p>

                <h4>What is BIG-IP Next?</h4>
                <p>BIG-IP is a networking and security solution that keeps websites and apps fast, secure, and reliable. It powers and protects an estimated <strong>70% of mobile and web applications worldwide</strong>‚Äîso if you've used your phone today, <strong>BIG-IP likely played a role!</strong></p>
   
                <p>&#128640 <a href="https://www.f5.com/products/big-ip/next">BIG-IP Next</a> is the next-generation evolution of this system‚Äîdesigned to be faster, lighter, and built for modern cloud and hybrid environments.

                <p><strong>Role:</strong> Intern and Customer Program Lead</p>
                <p><strong>Duration:</strong> November 2018 - June 2019</p>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    This was my core internship project at Lufthansa Technik, focused on improving the process by which customers could view their engine repairs. Aircraft engines consist of hundreds, sometimes thousands, of parts‚Äîranging from small screws to large components. Previously, the company managed this complex process using an Excel spreadsheet with individual line items for each part.
                </p>

                <h3>Key Contributions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Redesigned the customer-facing repair process to enhance transparency and usability.</li>
                    <li>Developed a digital solution to replace manual Excel tracking, improving data accuracy and accessibility.</li>
                    <li>Collaborated with engineers and technicians to streamline engine teardown workflows.</li>
                    <li>Ensured customers could easily track and understand the status of their engine repairs.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Notable Customers</h3>
                <p>In running this program, I worked with over 20 partners and customers to onboard them into the new engine teardown system, including Rolls Royce, Lufthansa, Eurowings, and Pratt & Whitney.</p>

                <h3>Results</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increased efficiency by reducing manual tracking errors.</li>
                    <li>Improved customer satisfaction through enhanced visibility into the repair process.</li>
                    <li>Streamlined collaboration between internal teams and customer-facing operations.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>
                    This project transformed the engine teardown repair tracking process at Lufthansa Technik, showcasing my ability to tackle complex challenges and deliver customer-focused solutions that improve operational efficiency.
