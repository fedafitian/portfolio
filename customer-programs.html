                <p><strong>Role:</strong> Intern and Customer Program Lead</p>
                <p><strong>Duration:</strong> November 2018 - June 2019</p>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    This was my core internship project at Lufthansa Technik, focused on improving the process by which customers could view their engine repairs. Aircraft engines consist of hundreds, sometimes thousands, of parts—ranging from small screws to large components. Previously, the company managed this complex process using an Excel spreadsheet with individual line items for each part.
                </p>

                <h3>Key Contributions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Redesigned the customer-facing repair process to enhance transparency and usability.</li>
                    <li>Developed a digital solution to replace manual Excel tracking, improving data accuracy and accessibility.</li>
                    <li>Collaborated with engineers and technicians to streamline engine teardown workflows.</li>
                    <li>Ensured customers could easily track and understand the status of their engine repairs.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Notable Customers</h3>
                <p>In running this program, I worked with over 20 partners and customers to onboard them into the new engine teardown system, including Rolls Royce, Lufthansa, Eurowings, and Pratt & Whitney.</p>

                <h3>Results</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increased efficiency by reducing manual tracking errors.</li>
                    <li>Improved customer satisfaction through enhanced visibility into the repair process.</li>
                    <li>Streamlined collaboration between internal teams and customer-facing operations.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>
                    This project transformed the engine teardown repair tracking process at Lufthansa Technik, showcasing my ability to tackle complex challenges and deliver customer-focused solutions that improve operational efficiency.
