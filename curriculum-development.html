                <strong>How it started: </strong> My journey into computer science was a happy accident. I was studying neuroscience on a pre-med track when a program requirement led me to take an elective outside my major coursework. I chose a 101 web development course, and it just clicked. I fell in love from my first coding assignment and knew I had found something special. 
            </p>
            <p>
                But I discovered computer science midway through my college studies, and I couldn’t help but wonder how different things could have been if I had known about it earlier. That’s why, before starting my full-time career, I wanted to share this incredible field with as many students as I could.
            </p>
            <p>
                Curriculum development has been at the heart of my career, combining my technical expertise with my passion for teaching. From guiding young students to discover the joy of coding, to designing project-based STEM programs that connect creativity with real-world applications, my goal has always been to empower the next generation of innovators.

            <h2>Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program</h2>
            <p>
                This fast-paced boot camp for high school students gave me the privilege of guiding 40 young women through their first steps into the world of computer science. It wasn’t just about coding—it was about building confidence, encouraging collaboration, and showing them that tech can be both empowering and fun.</p>

            <p><strong>What We Explored:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scratch, Python, Arduino, and more—languages and tools that brought ideas to life.</li>
                <li>Group projects addressing real-world challenges, from building games to creating websites.</li>
                <li>Workshops on college applications, career mentorship, and building a supportive community of future technologists.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Watching the students’ creativity and confidence grow over the summer was incredibly inspiring. Many of them went on to pursue STEM in college, and knowing I played a small part in their journeys is something I’ll always be proud of.

            <h2>Zaniac Curriculums</h2>
            <h4>Story Time!</h4>
            <p>Building new curriculums for Zaniac started as a way to solve a practical problem when I was 20 years old and running a little low on rent money. However, it ended up making a legacy to thousands of students across the U.S.</p> 
            <p>  At the time, I was working as an instructor at Zaniac and noticed that while the programs we offered were great, students weren’t returning once they’d completed them. Parents wanted their kids to stay engaged, but we simply didn’t have enough new content to keep them interested.</p> 
            <p>That’s when I approached the owner with an idea: create new curriculums to expand what we offered and give students more reasons to come back.</p>
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>At Zaniac, I developed learning programs that combined technical skills with creativity to engage students in a hands-on, project-based learning environment. Each curriculum was designed to inspire curiosity and foster problem-solving, whether through drone engineering or costume design.</p>

            <!-- <h3>Engineering Takes Flight – Drones Curriculum</h3> -->
            <p>
                This program gave students the chance to explore drone technology while learning physics, geometry, and programming. They didn’t just learn how drones worked—they built them, programmed them, and saw their creations take flight.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Constructed and programmed two drone models, merging engineering and computer science fundamentals.</li>
                <li>Completed challenges demonstrating real-world applications like delivery systems and aerial exploration.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Seeing the joy on students’ faces as their drones flew for the first time was unforgettable. This program launched across 9 states and 10 campuses in 2017, inspiring hundreds of young minds.

            <p>
                What do Earth’s climates and Star Wars planets have in common? This curriculum took students on a journey through science and design, teaching them how environments shape everything from landscapes to clothing.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Explored Earth’s climates and compared them to the fictional terrains of Star Wars planets.</li>
                <li>Analyzed how costumes in Star Wars were designed to match each planet’s environment.</li>
                <li>Created their own Star Wars-inspired costumes using Inkscape, blending science with art.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The creativity students brought to this course was astounding. From designing costumes to imagining their own Star Wars planets, this program was a perfect mix of science and imagination.

            <p>
                What makes a superhero costume iconic? This curriculum helped students uncover the secrets of great design while creating their own superhero suits. By studying design principles and connecting them to functionality, students learned how to think like graphic designers.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Analyzed superhero costumes to understand the relationship between design and function.</li>
                <li>Learned foundational design principles like color, shape, and line.</li>
                <li>Used Inkscape to create original superhero costumes balancing creativity with purpose.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Watching students bring their superhero visions to life was truly rewarding. This curriculum was a launchpad for their creativity and a deeper understanding of design.

            <p>
                Designed for middle schoolers (Grades 6-8), this curriculum introduced students to the fundamentals of data science and its impact across industries. It combined hands-on learning with real-world applications, sparking curiosity and creativity.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Explained key concepts in data science, including data collection, analysis, and visualization.</li>
                <li>Led students in building a Python algorithm to analyze tweets from brands like Nike or Starbucks, determining whether they had positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.</li>
                <li>Focused on developing pattern-finding and problem-solving skills through a fun, interactive project.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This workshop not only taught students the basics of Python but also inspired them to see the power of data in understanding human behavior and solving problems.

                Created for high school freshmen and sophomores, this curriculum challenged students to think critically about social issues and use technology as a force for change. Students worked in teams to design and prototype mobile apps focused on causes they were passionate about.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Encouraged students to start by identifying what made them angry or passionate about change.</li>
                <li>Taught students how to wireframe and prototype apps using Figma, combining creativity with technical skills.</li>
                <li>Addressed topics like homelessness in Seattle, climate change, and public health during the pandemic.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The students showcased their projects at TAF’s annual STEM Expo, presenting their innovative ideas and demonstrating their technical and collaborative skills. This curriculum empowered them with tools to create change and added valuable experience to their resumes.
