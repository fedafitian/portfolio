            <p>
                Curriculum development has been at the heart of my career, combining my technical expertise with my passion for teaching. From guiding young students to discover the joy of coding, to designing project-based STEM programs that connect creativity with real-world applications, my goal has always been to empower the next generation of innovators.

            <h2>Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program</h2>
            <p>
                The Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program was a fast-paced boot camp for high school students, where I had the privilege of guiding 20 young women through their first steps into the world of computer science. It wasn’t just about coding—it was about building confidence, encouraging collaboration, and showing them that tech can be both empowering and fun.
            </p>
            <p><strong>What We Explored:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Scratch, Python, Arduino, and more—languages and tools that brought ideas to life.</li>
        <li>Group projects addressing real-world challenges, from building games to creating websites.</li>
        <li>Workshops on college applications, career mentorship, and building a supportive community of future technologists.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Seeing the students’ creativity and confidence grow over the summer was inspiring. Many of them went on to pursue 
        STEM in college, and I’m proud to have been part of their journey.

        <!-- Zaniac Curriculums Section -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Zaniac Curriculums</h2>
            <p>
                At Zaniac, I developed programs that combined technical skills with creativity to engage students in a hands-on, project-based learning environment. Each curriculum was designed to inspire curiosity and foster problem-solving, whether through drone engineering or costume design.
            </p>

            <!-- Drones Curriculum -->
            <h3>Engineering Takes Flight – Drones Curriculum</h3>
            <p>
                This program gave students the chance to explore drone technology while learning physics, geometry, and programming. They didn’t just learn how drones worked—they built them, programmed them, and saw their creations take flight.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Constructed and programmed two drone models, merging engineering and computer science fundamentals.</li>
                <li>Completed challenges demonstrating real-world applications like delivery systems and aerial exploration.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Seeing the joy on students’ faces as their drones flew for the first time was unforgettable. This program launched across 9 states and 10 campuses in 2017, inspiring hundreds of young minds.
            </p>

            <!-- Star Wars Curriculum -->
            <h3>Climates Curriculum – Star Wars Edition</h3>
            <p>
                What do Earth’s climates and Star Wars planets have in common? This curriculum took students on a journey through science and design, teaching them how environments shape everything from landscapes to clothing.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Explored Earth’s climates and compared them to the fictional terrains of Star Wars planets.</li>
                <li>Analyzed how costumes in Star Wars were designed to match each planet’s environment.</li>
                <li>Created their own Star Wars-inspired costumes using Inkscape, blending science with art.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The creativity students brought to this course was astounding. From designing costumes to imagining their own Star Wars planets, this program was a perfect mix of science and imagination.
            </p>

            <!-- Superhero Curriculum -->
            <h3>Elements of Design – Superhero Edition</h3>
            <p>
                What makes a superhero costume iconic? This curriculum helped students uncover the secrets of great design while creating their own superhero suits. By studying design principles and connecting them to functionality, students learned how to think like graphic designers.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Analyzed superhero costumes to understand the relationship between design and function.</li>
                <li>Learned foundational design principles like color, shape, and line.</li>
                <li>Used Inkscape to create original superhero costumes balancing creativity with purpose.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Watching students bring their superhero visions to life was truly rewarding. This curriculum was a launchpad for their creativity and a deeper understanding of design.

            <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
            <p>
                Every curriculum I’ve created is rooted in the belief that learning should be engaging, hands-on, and inspiring. As I continue this journey, I look forward to creating more programs that empower students to think critically, dream big, and turn their ideas into reality.
